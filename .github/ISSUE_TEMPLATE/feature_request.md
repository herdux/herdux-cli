## 🚀 What problem does this feature solve?

A clear and concise description of the problem. e.g., I always feel anxious when running `clean` and I would like to have a "dry run" mode.

## 💡 What is your ideal solution?

Explain how you imagine the new command or feature functioning.

Example:

```bash
herdux clean --dry-run
# Returns only a list of databases that would be affected without actually dropping them.
```

## 🔄 Alternatives Considered

Are there other ways to work around this currently? Did you consider using a different flag?

## 📝 Additional Context

Add any other context or links to documentation here (e.g., links to tools like pg_dump documentation if the feature involves them).
